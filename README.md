# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis_folder
## Overview of the Analysis
The comapny Pewlett Hackard is approaching an important milestone - The Silver Tsunami. The company wants to provide the retiring generation with a nice retirement bonus so they are set up for the rest of their days. Since many individuals will be retiring, the company will have to hire a variety of people to support the company. That being said, the company also wants to implement a mentorship program to ensure that the new employees have enough guidance to be productive members of the Pewlett-Hackard family!

To successful complete the analysis I built an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to capture the relationships that I found in the supplied data.
